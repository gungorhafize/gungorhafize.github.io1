When you want to upload an android application to Huawei AppGallery, you must first obtain an account and log in.
You need to create the application you will install in AppGallery Connect.
# 1) Log into AppGallery Connect and click "Apps".

</p>

# 2) Click on "New App".

</p>

Then, after selecting the options such as application name, category, default language in the window that opens, we move on to the next step.

</p>

The point to note here is that "Add to Project" should be marked. This part will be required for the SHA-256 finger-print certificate in the next steps.
 
# 3) On the Distribute tab, go to Version Information > Draft.
After completing the app information section, in the software version area, click "Software Packages" and upload the software package. We can upload apk or .aab file here, but it would be a more logical option for you to install app bundle in terms of efficiency and optimization.

</p>

In order to add the app bundle, we click on the "Software packages" button and "Upload" from the window that opens. However, since our application has not been signed yet, there will be an expression stating that we need to switch to the App Signature module in the Services section on the left tab.

## üìù App Signing 

Android apps use a private key for signing. To ensure reliable application updates, each private key has an associated public key certificate. Devices and services can use the public key certificate to check whether an application is from a trusted source. An application update is considered reliable only when the update signature matches the signature of the uploaded application and the update is performed. Here again, there are two options.

</p>

The first one marked here is the recommended one so that AppGallery Connect can properly manage and maintain your application signature key, it is recommended that you use App Signing - App Signing service and use the key to sign your app for distribution. The service securely stores the signature key and secures your content even in case of key loss or theft.

The second option, on the other hand, may expose you to the risk of not being able to update your application if your key is lost or stolen. In this case, you will need to use a new package name to publish the updated application.
The signing process for a new app is slightly different than for a published app.
